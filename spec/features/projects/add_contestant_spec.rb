# User Story Extension 2 - Adding a contestant to a project
# â€‹
# I see a form to add a contestant to this project
# When I fill out a field with an existing contestants id
# And hit "Add Contestant To Project"
# I'm taken back to the project's show page
# And I see that the number of contestants has increased by 1
# And when I visit the contestants index page
# I see that project listed under that contestant's name
